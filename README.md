# [Gallyt](https://gallyt.netlify.com)

> Git web client

We decide to create Gallyt to allow us to follow our favorite git repositories from many forges like bitbucket, github, gitlab (gitlab.com & self-hosted) with a backendless application. Our goal for this hackaton was to create a Proof of Concept with a single repository reader.

**Please,** use latest `chrome` or `chromium` to test. (Currently Firefox don't implement some fetch functionalities that we need)
